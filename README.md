Agile Methodology
Agile is a flexible, iterative approach that focuses on continuous improvement and customer feedback. Here are some key characteristics:

Iterative Development: Work is divided into small, manageable units called sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks.
Flexibility: Agile welcomes changes even late in the development process, allowing teams to adapt to new requirements or feedback.
Collaboration: Frequent interaction with stakeholders ensures that the project aligns with their needs and expectations.
Self-Organizing Teams: Teams are empowered to make decisions and manage their own work, which can lead to higher motivation and productivity.
Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall is a more traditional, linear approach where each phase of the project must be completed before moving on to the next. Here are some key characteristics:

Sequential Phases: The project progresses through a series of defined stages: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Clear Documentation: Each phase produces detailed documentation, which helps in maintaining clarity and accountability.
Predictability: Since all requirements are defined upfront, the project timeline and costs are more predictable.
Less Flexibility: Changes are harder to implement once a phase is completed, making it less adaptable to new requirements or feedback.
Comparing Agile and Waterfall
Flexibility: Agile is highly flexible and can adapt to changes quickly, while Waterfall is more rigid and follows a strict sequence.
Customer Involvement: Agile involves continuous customer feedback, whereas Waterfall typically involves customers mainly at the beginning and end of the project.
Project Size and Complexity: Agile is well-suited for projects with evolving requirements and smaller teams, while Waterfall is better for large, complex projects with well-defined requirements.
When to Use Each Methodology
Agile: Ideal for projects where requirements are expected to change or are not well-defined from the start. It is also suitable for projects that benefit from frequent customer feedback and iterative development.
Waterfall: Best for projects with clear, stable requirements and where a structured approach is needed. It is also suitable for projects where documentation and traceability are crucial.

How does software engineering impact cybersecurity?

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term “software engineering” was officially coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This conference highlighted the need for a more structured approach to software development due to the increasing complexity and size of software systems1. It marked the beginning of software engineering as a recognized discipline, emphasizing the importance of systematic methodologies and best practices.

2. Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)
The 1980s saw the rise of object-oriented programming (OOP), a paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic2. OOP introduced concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, which made software more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. This shift significantly improved the way software was designed and developed, leading to more robust and scalable systems.

3. Advent of Agile Methodologies (2001)
In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was published, introducing Agile methodologies as a response to the limitations of traditional, rigid development processes like Waterfall2. Agile emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development. It has since become a dominant approach in software development, allowing teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements and deliver high-quality software more efficiently.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

2. Requirements Definition
This phase involves converting the gathered information into detailed requirements. These requirements serve as a blueprint for the development team, outlining what the software should do1.

3. Design
During the design phase, the software’s architecture is created. This includes defining the overall system architecture, data models, and user interfaces. The design phase ensures that the software will meet the specified requirements1.

4. Development
In this phase, the actual coding takes place. Developers write the code based on the design documents and specifications. This is where the software starts to take shape1.

5. Testing
Testing is crucial to ensure the software is free of bugs and meets the requirements. This phase involves various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing1.

6. Deployment
Once the software has been tested and is deemed ready, it is deployed to the production environment. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and user training1.

7. Maintenance
After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This involves fixing any issues that arise, making updates, and adding new features as needed1
